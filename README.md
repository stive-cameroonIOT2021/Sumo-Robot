# Sumo-Robot

This sumo robot is a compact and agile battle bot powered by an Arduino Nano and mounted on a jSumo M1 board. Equipped with two QTR sensors, it detects the edge of the arena to avoid falling out. Three IR proximity sensors allow it to detect opponents from various angles, ensuring it can track and push them out of the ring. The robotâ€™s small, efficient design and responsive sensors make it an ideal choice for sumo competitions, where precision and quick reflexes are key to dominating opponents.
